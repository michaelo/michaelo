Hello! I'm @michaelo and I'm a Norwegian developer.

My main areas of interest is tooling, game development and super-niche projects.

My professional background spans across safety critical (soft) real-time systems, web, some game-dev and IT-automation.

I occasionally [tweet](https://twitter.com/miodden) and answer [random questions](https://www.quora.com/profile/Michael-Odden), but are most likely occupied developing something.

I value software respecting the users time, hardware and sanity over avoiding to write some extra lines of code.

I value local-native tooling and local-first tools over cloud services.

I am in absolute no capacity interested in working with cryptocurrencies and/or the associated set of permissionless blockchains considered Web3 or "crypto".

I believe our purchased hardware is ours to use however we like, and should not be locked-in by e.g. operating systems and such
