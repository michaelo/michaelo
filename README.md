Hello! I'm @michaelo and I'm a Norwegian developer.

My main areas of interests are tooling, game development and super-niche projects.

My professional background spans across safety critical (mostly soft) real-time systems, web, some game-dev and IT-automation.

I occasionally [tweet](https://twitter.com/miodden) and answer [random questions](https://www.quora.com/profile/Michael-Odden), but are most likely doing something else. I can also be found on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelodden/).

I value software respecting the users time, hardware and sanity over avoiding to write some extra lines of code.

I value local-native tooling and local-first tools over cloud services.

I am in absolute no capacity interested in working with cryptocurrencies and/or the associated set of permissionless blockchains considered Web3 or "crypto".

I'm against specific ML-solution that does not properly attribute and/or compensate the sources upon which they are built, regardless of their appearant novelty.

I believe our purchased hardware is ours to use however we like, and should not be locked-in by e.g. operating systems and such.
